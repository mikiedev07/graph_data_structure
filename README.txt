What is presented here:

1) Reading a graph from a file, in which the graph must be represented in the form of vertex 
indices and a list of edges;

2) Displaying the read graph on the screen;

3) Performing a breadth-first search and depth-first search on the graph from a user-specified 
vertex to the final one; in this case, the identifiers of the vertices in the visiting order 
should be displayed, and for each visited vertex, the traversed path to it from the starting 
vertex should be displayed.

*For correct operation, at the beginning it is necessary to display the graph with a button!

Vertex indices, their coordinates and a list of edges are contained in the file "input_data.txt".
